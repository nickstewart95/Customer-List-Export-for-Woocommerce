# Customer List Export for WooCommerce

for Wordpress and WooCommerce, PHP 7.4+

## What it is

Customer List Export for WooCommerce allows you to export a CSV of customer data (name/address/if has subscription). In the frontend, the
columns are sortable and there is a live search feature.

The data is pulled from WooCommerce orders and is then filtered to remove duplicates. This data cab be filtered at a high level by choosing either billing
or shipping addresses.
